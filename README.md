Welcome to the PBPK Models Repository, where we share physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) codes developed to predict target site pharmacokinetics (PK) in various therapeutic contexts.


**Available PBPK Models**

This repository includes the following PBPK models:

1. Osimertinib PBPK Model in Lung Cancer:
A detailed PBPK model designed to predict the pharmacokinetics of osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI, in patients with lung cancer.

_Applications_: Understanding drug distribution, target-site exposure, and aiding in personalized therapy approaches.

2. [18F]F-DCFPyL and [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 PBPK Model in Prostate Cancer Patients:
A comprehensive PBPK model that simulates the biodistribution of [18F]F-DCFPyL (diagnostic tracer) and [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 (therapeutic agent) in patients with prostate cancer.

_Applications_: Prediction of target-site PK, dose optimization, and theranostic research.
